This interface helps you to improve your R skills. Here you can access to a data set called `starwars`

# Manipulations

For example: Print the `starwars` dataset.

```{webr-r}
starwars

Great! Analyze the `starwars`dataset and start playing around.

```{webr-r}

```

```{webr-r}

```

```{webr-r}

```

# Visualisations

Here's a basic visualization that I did using `starwars` dataset.

```{webr-r}
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = gender)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "darkgrey")
```

```{webr-r}

```

```{webr-r}

```

```{webr-r}
